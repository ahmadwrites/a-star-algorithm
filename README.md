## A Star Algorithm Implementation
A simple implementation of the A* algorithm using Manhattan distance. The number of grids can be changed dynamically. 
This was a weekend project that focuses less on design and instead the logic of things. Putting into practice
data structures and algorithms learnt in my studies.
